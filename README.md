# Passket
A Secure yet Transparent way to store your password

Passket (Password-Bucket) is a password manager which stores all of the user’s password in an encrypted way which even “we” can’t access to it. 

> Passket uses AES128 cipher algorithm to encrypt all the user’s data. 

This is implemented using NextJS (With Typescript), MongoDB, Python and Supabase.

# Why Passket ?

As most of the users save their password in Notes app or with Google Password Manager, If the device gets compromised then its GAME OVER. Thats why we made Passket which requires a specific pin to access your passwords everytime.

So even if the device gets compromised, your passwords won’t. It’s also synced across devices so you can easily access it from anywhere, anytime.

> Even we can’t grab your passwords. That’s how secure it is !
